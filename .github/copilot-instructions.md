# Copilot Instructions for DIO-Python

This repository is a collection of Python scripts for learning and practicing core language features, based on the "Vivo - Python AI Backend Developer" bootcamp. The codebase is organized for educational purposes, with each file demonstrating specific Python concepts.

## Project Structure
- `tipos-de-dados/`: Main directory containing Python scripts for different topics:
  - `primeiro_programa.py`: Basic Python syntax and first program
  - `conhecendo_linguagem.py`, `dados.py`, `string.py`, `operadores.py`: Data types, string manipulation, operators
  - `condicionais_repeticao.py`: Conditional statements and loops, including practical examples

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- Scripts are standalone and interactive, often using `input()` for user data
- Code is heavily commented in Portuguese to explain concepts and logic
- Naming conventions follow simple, descriptive patterns in Portuguese (e.g., `saldo`, `saque`, `vogais_encontradas`)
- No external dependencies or package management; pure Python only
- No test framework or build system is present; scripts are run directly

## Developer Workflow
- To run a script, open the file and execute it in a Python environment (e.g., VS Code, terminal)
- No compilation or setup steps required
- Debugging is done by modifying and re-running scripts
- There are no automated tests; validation is manual via script output

## Examples of Important Patterns
- **Conditional Logic**: See `condicionais_repeticao.py` for `if`, `elif`, `else` usage and ternary expressions
- **Loops**: Both `for` and `while` loops are demonstrated, including iteration over ranges and strings
- **String Processing**: Example in `condicionais_repeticao.py` for extracting vowels from user input
- **Tabuada (Multiplication Table)**: Simple loop-based generation in `condicionais_repeticao.py`

## Integration Points
- No external APIs, libraries, or services are integrated
- Scripts do not communicate with each other; each is self-contained

## How to Contribute
- Add new scripts to `tipos-de-dados/` following the existing naming and commenting style
- Keep code simple and focused on illustrating Python concepts
- Use Portuguese for comments and variable names to maintain consistency

For questions about conventions or unclear patterns, review the comments in each script or ask for clarification.
